# Contributing to Greave

Greave is my own personal project which I intend to work on long-term - however, as many of my favourite games are more enjoyable
with mods, I welcome suggestions and contributions from anyone who enjoys the project! If you're interested in contributing to
Greave, here are the things to bear in mind:

1. **Be cool.** I can't stress this one enough. We're all friends here, so please behave. More specifically, I expect everyone
interacting with this project on GitHub to abide by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2. This project is open-source (licensed under the
[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](../LICENSE)), so you are of course welcome to
take the existing code, modify it to your heart's content, and release your own modified versions of what you think the game
should be like! With that in mind, I'm *very* open to suggestions and improvements, and I'd be much happier working with the
community to include new features and changes you folks think would be cool. While I reserve the right to have the final word in
what is (or is not) included in this official main repository of Greave, you're still free to make and release your own mods or
modded versions.

3. I have lots of ideas for this project; probably more than I'll ever have time to implement. If you think you have a great idea
for something to add to it, please feel free to contact me first - either here on GitHub or via email at
[gc@gravecat.com](mailto:gc@gravecat.com) - as it's entirely possible I may already be working on something similar to what you
have in mind, or have plans to implement something of the sort in the future. I'd much rather work with folks in expanding the
game together, rather than people writing code only to discover I've already started coding the same feature.

4. As mentioned in the [readme](README.md), Greave is currently in a *very* early
pre-alpha state, and development is rather chaotic as I'm currently combining mechanics, code and other elements from several
other former, personal game projects, most of which were previously closed-source. The current plan is to try to reach feature
parity with my old projects - salvaging as much as possible to combine into this one single game project - before I then start
to focus on working on all-new features.

So with that in mind, you want to contribute? Great! Here's a few ways you can do that!

* Head to the [issues page](https://github.com/Gravecat/Greave/issues), do a quick search to see if the bug report or feature
suggestion you have in mind is already there, and if not, go ahead and open a new issue. I personally review everything posted
on the issues page, and I especially welcome reports of bugs I'm unaware of! :)

* Fork or clone the Greave repository and start tinkering! I'm open to any reasonable
[pull requests](https://github.com/Gravecat/Greave/pulls), though as mentioned above, I reserve the right to personally decide
which content makes it into the main repository. If in doubt, feel free to shoot me an email with your suggestions first. **Due
to the project's license, any pull requests must be licensed under either the same license as the main project (Gnu AGPLv3 or
later), or [another GPL-compatible license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses).**

* Greave is free and open-source forever; I'm working on this project because I love coding and want to make a great game! With
that said, I have a [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/gravecat) where I will gratefully accept any donations towards the game's
development.

* If you enjoy Greave, tell your friends about it! :)
